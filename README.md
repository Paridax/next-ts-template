# Paridax's Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS Template

This is a template for Next.js, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It is an opinionated template that includes a few things that I like to use in my projects. It is not meant to be a one-size-fits-all template, but rather a starting point for your own project. Feel free to copy this repository and modify it to your liking.

## TailwindCSS

[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a versatile tool for building custom user interfaces. It is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a large number of pre-built classes that can be used to quickly build interfaces without having to write any CSS.

When working with Tailwind, classes will be automatically compiled in `styles/globals.css`.

TailwindCSS documentation can be found [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

## TypeScript

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It is a great tool for writing more robust code and catching errors before they happen.

## Getting Started with Next.js

This is an altered [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), and created by Paridax.

To begin with, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
